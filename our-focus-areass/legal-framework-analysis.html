                                Application of organisation development principles in public institutions necessarily
                                requires an exhaustive understanding of the legal framework in which the institution is
                                placed. It helps gain better appreciation of the opportunities, challenges as well as
                                boundaries to be considered while designing the change processes.

                                For e.g., in the case of rural local governance, there are many externalities which
                                impact functioning of Gram Panchayats: Is there an enabling legal devolution to the
                                Panchayati Raj Institutions by the State Government? Even in the presence of enabling
                                legal mandate, does the State administration provide space to the panchayats to function
                                as institutions of local self government, or are the panchayats primarily implementation
                                arms of the State? Is there an aware citizenry which performs its role as an oversight
                                body, through various mechanisms instituted in the Panchayat Raj Acts, such as Gram
                                Sabhas, Beneficiary committees etc.? Do the panchayats have access to information to aid
                                their decision-making?
                            </p>
