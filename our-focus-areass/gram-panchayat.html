            <p style="text-align:justify;">Panchayats have been constitutionally recognized as local self-governments in
                Part IX, Constitution of India, through its 73rd Amendment, 1992, and are to be constituted at the
                village, intermediate and district levels, referred to as Panchayat Raj Institutions (PRIs). The
                Eleventh Schedule of the Constitution provides a list of functions, which can be devolved to the PRIs,
                subject to appropriate legislation by the respective State government. Gram Panchayat is to be
                constituted for a village or a group of villages, as per notification of the State.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify">The GPOD framework involves application Organisation Development (OD)
                principles in this space of public administration, recognising Gram Panchayats as organisations with
                need for clarity on its different components such as vision, processes and systems, structure and roles
                as well as mechanisms to strengthen affiliation of its members with the institution.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align:justify;">The conceptual framework for applying OD principles to GPs was devised in an
                action research mode with two GPs in Karnataka in 2011. Change was initiated through a step-by-step
                framework in GP bodies, specifics of which were designed in collaboration with the members of the
                panchayats. Since its inception in 2011, the GPOD framework has been continuously evolving,
                incorporating learnings from our experiences in different states. Needless to say, this is broad
                framework and needs to be contextualized based on the socio-political and legal environment of the state
                where it is to be deployed. The GPOD framework is presently being deployed across Karnataka, Jharkhand,
                Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. <a href="../projects.html"><span

                        Action Research GPs resulted in systemic and service delivery outcomes as summarized below. </p>
                    <ul class="tab_ul">
                        <li>Oorkunte Mittur and Dibburhalli GPs developed their own vision and instituted annual plans
                            and budgets with a clear accountability structure for overseeing different functions of the
                            panchayats. During the two year implementation period of the project, the GPs implemented up
                            to 70 percent of their plans. </li>
                        <li>Systems were instituted to address complaints and resolution norms and timelines were fixed.
                            For e.g., streetlights were repaired within a 48 hour period, contact numbers of Heads of
                            portfolios in the GP were displayed across the villages for problems related to water,
                            ration etc. Both GPs ensured that nearly all ration shops displayed the monthly grain stock
                            received and daily stock position for all commodities, as per government norms.</li>
                        <li>Dibburhalli GP was a top performer in achieving NREGA goals in 2013-14 and collected water
                            tax to the tune of Rs 1 lakh versus a targeted Rs 1.75 lakh in 2014-15. Oorkunte Mittur GP
                            facilitated the formation of 10 Raita Samparka Kootas (Farmer Contact groups) and ensured
                            timely distribution of subsidized seeds to over 2,300 farmers. </li>
                        <li>Mandated citizen committees such as the VWSC (Village Water and Sanitation Committee), Bal
                            Vikas Samiti (Child Welfare Committee), SDMC (School Development and Monitoring Committee),
                            which were previously defunct were activated. There was also a marked increase in citizens
                            participating in mandated Ward sabhas and Gram sabhas. </li>
